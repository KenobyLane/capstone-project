<p><h4>Hi, my name is Emeka-Okonkwo, i am a christian, i'm from Nigeria, i am a software developer and also a self-taught artist.
     currently, i am studying an online course about Javascript, HTML & CSS to further broaden my knowledge on front/ back-end web development. </p>

<p>Apart from Javascript ,i am also familiar with C++ computing language but i won't say am an expert.
presently my goal is to acquire enough knowledge on software develpoment so i can launch my own personal product someday on the internet</p>

<p>whenever i am away from coding, i spend most of my time playing video-games or sketching portraits
